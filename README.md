# Gravity_Matrix
This reposotory was made to keep track of the Gravity Matrix class that I made for a fun as a test without using any Python modules. 
The purpose is to shift all missing values of marked by the string 'm', to the top of the matrix. 
There are 2 methods for this matrix: 
1) Rotates the matrix to the right and then gravitationally pulls all the 'm' strings to the top
2) Rotates the matrix to the left and then gravitationally pulls all the 'm' strings to the top
